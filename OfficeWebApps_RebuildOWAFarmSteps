#Office Web Apps 2013 - Rebuild your Farm in a few Easy Steps!
#Because there is minimal configuration overhead (from an Office Web Apps perspective) and zero data loss, there is little risk to rebuilding a farm.  These steps can be a legitimate part of an action plan for resolving technical issues with Office Web Apps. 

#1. Take farm offline (if there is a load balancer)
#2. Collect the current Farm information via Powershell (on WAC Server): 

Get-OfficeWebAppsFarm > c:\MyWACfarm.txt
	
#3. (If multi-server farm) use Powershell (on WAC Servers) to remove each child machine from the farm, then remove the parent machine.  This will delete the farm.

Remove-OfficeWebAppsMachine
	
#4. Reboot the Office Web Apps server(s).
#5. Recreate the farm via Powershell (on WAC Server) using (if appropriate) the parameter values from "MyWACfarm.txt".

New-OfficeWebAppsFarm -InternalURL "http://WACServer.corp.contoso.com" -AllowHttp -EditingEnabled -OpenFromURLEnabled

#6. Reunite the children with their parent via Powershell (on WAC Server).  Run this from each child server: 

New-OfficeWebAppsMachine -MachineToJoin <ParentServer>
	
#7. Bring farm back online.
#Note: You may want to rebuild the bindings via SharePoint Powershell (on SharePoint Server):

Remove-SPWOPIBinding –All:$true
New-SPWOPIBinding –ServerName “WACServer.corp.contoso.com” -AllowHttp

#Note: You need to replace values with the correct information from your farm.
